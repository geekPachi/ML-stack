indicator Variable: Creating an additional binary indicator variable to represent missingness.

In this example, we have a DataFrame df with two variables: 'X' and 'Y'. We want to create binary indicator variables, 
'X_missing' and 'Y_missing', to represent the missingness of values in the respective columns. 
The isnull() method checks whether each value is missing (null/NaN) and returns a boolean mask. By applying the astype(int) method, 
we convert the boolean values to integers, where missing values are represented as 1 and non-missing values as 0.


import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataframe with missing values
data = {
    'X': [1, 2, 3, None, 5],
    'Y': [6, None, 8, 9, 10]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create binary indicator variables for missingness
df['X_missing'] = df['X'].isnull().astype(int)
df['Y_missing'] = df['Y'].isnull().astype(int)

print(df)
