Transformation:
Apply a transformation to the data that reduces the impact of outliers. For example, you can take the logarithm or 
square root of skewed variables to make the distribution more symmetric.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample dataframe with a skewed variable
data = {
    'X': [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 100]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Apply logarithmic transformation to reduce skewness
df['X_log'] = np.log(df['X'])

print(df)
