Detection: Identifying outliers using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).

Identifying outliers in a dataset is an important step in data analysis. Statistical
methods such as Z-score and IQR (interquartile range) are commonly used for outlier detection. 

1. Z-score

import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import zscore

# Create a sample dataframe
data = {
    'X': [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 100]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate Z-scores
df['Z_score'] = zscore(df['X'])

# Set a threshold for outlier detection
threshold = 2

# Identify outliers based on the Z-score threshold
df['Outlier'] = df['Z_score'].apply(lambda x: abs(x) > threshold)

print(df)
